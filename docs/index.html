    <h3>Technical Details</h3>

    <h4>Backend</h4>
    <p>
      I used Spring Boot to create a REST API, it communicates with the LCU API.
      Currently it is a wrapper for making requests from frontend to LCU API.
      Later on I am planning to provide a connection to a website to provide
      some extra functionalities.
    </p>

    <h4>Frontend</h4>
    <p>
      Frontend uses ReactJs, currently it can be reached through a browser tab,
      later I will make it a complete desktop app using ElectronJs. Currently
